Overview
--------

This is the source code for the [Alocola iPhone application](http://www.alocola.com).


What's Alocola?
---------------

On its own, Alocola is a simple application that uses the iPhone's location-services to present your position, altitude, speed and course. When paired with a website, Alocola enables the website to be location aware.

Alocola is a web-helper application that lets users provide their location information when websites ask for it.

Alocola works with Safari, the built-in web browser. With Alocola, web developers don't need to create their own iPhone app. Users simply browse in Safari the way they normally would; when a site asks for location information Alocola pops up, asks permission to give the location to the site, returns to Safari and passes the location along as part of the URL.


Using Alocola With A Website
